# Usb_Autorun
This is a project to run a script when a usb is connected(Like Rubber Ducky)
# Difference b/w usb Rubber Ducky and Autorun
Usb Rubber Ducky has a inbuilt microcontroller which automatically runs the code when usb is connected, But you have to have this code ran into ur system and a `yourscript.extention` in your usb drive.
# Directions for Proper Execution
